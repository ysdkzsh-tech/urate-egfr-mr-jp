  how_to_reproduce: |
    1) Obtain public summaries (ToMMo TGA000007; BBJ instruments). 
    2) Run PLINK pipelines as in code/plink/*.sh for QC/PCA/GWAS.
    3) Generate phenotypes/covariates with Stata do-file (code/stata/main_analysis.do).
    4) Run MR with code/R/mr_analysis.R; outputs correspond to files listed above.
